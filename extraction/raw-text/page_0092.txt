Appendix 7 â€“ Explanation of Reserves
Land and Property Acquisition Reserve (LPAR)
This reserve was established in 2000 to provide additional funding to meet the costs of
acquiring land for land bank and other purposes. The reserve enables Government to react
swiftly when land and buildings required for public services become available. Land bank
transactions, both planned and unplanned, are made through the Capital Account. The
expenditure on unplanned land and building transactions are met by transfers from the Land
and Property Acquisition Reserve.
