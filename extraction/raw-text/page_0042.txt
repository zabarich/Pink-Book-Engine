Isle of Man Budget 2025-26
The Capital Programme
Historically after the end of each financial year, the Treasury has brought to Tynwald a list of
Capital Supplementary Authorities for amounts of capital expenditure which form part of the
overall approved budget for various capital programme items. Due to the nature and timing of
those items over a number of financial years, the actual level of expenditure in any one year
may exceed the specific budget approval for that year.
The delegated authority from Tynwald to the Treasury remains in place. This allows the
Treasury to approve, where appropriate, the funding of scheme overspends up to £2,000,000.
Departments will still be required to explain any project overspends where necessary.
6.5 Manx Development Corporation
Manx Development Corporation Limited (MDC), an Isle of Man company, was incorporated
on 31 March 2021 as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Treasury.
MDC was established to operate on an arm’s length basis from Treasury to make a long term
contribution to urban and brownfield regeneration in the Isle of Man.
MDC are currently working on various developments, including the Former Nurses Home on
Westmoreland Road. The MDC board have identified several potential sites for which they are
conducting feasibility studies in order to bring full business cases forward for consideration.
Where projects are to be taken into development, the MDC will be expected to seek loan
funding on commercial terms, either from Treasury or from external sources, to finance any
construction costs.
Any further equity or loan funding to the MDC will be considered as and when specific projects
are identified and this has not been included within the 2025-26 budget. This funding will be
made available from the Consolidated Loans Fund.
