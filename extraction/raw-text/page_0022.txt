For the 2025-26 tax year, the lower rate of income tax remains at 10% and the higher rate will
decrease from 22% to 21%.
The threshold up to which the lower rate of income tax applies remains at £6,500 for a single
person and £13,000 for a jointly assessed couple. The Personal Allowance will increase from
£14,500 to £14,750 for a resident individual and from £29,000 to £29,500 for a jointly assessed
couple.
Allowances are fully transferrable between husband and wife or civil partners whilst the couple
are living together and provided they elect for joint treatment. Special arrangements apply in
the years of marriage/partnership, separation, death or where independent taxation applies.
The personal allowance will continue to be reduced by £1 for every £2 that a person’s total
income is above £100,000. This means if a person’s total income is £129,500 or above their
personal allowance will be zero.
The single parent allowance will remain at £6,400 and the blind or disabled person’s allowance
at £2,900.
The rate of income tax on taxable income for non-resident individuals will also decrease from
22% to 21%.
Individuals will continue to have the option to make a Tax Cap election for a five or ten year
period. From 6 April 2025, the income tax liability for an individual under a new tax cap election
will increase to £220,000 and to £440,000 for a jointly assessed couple.
For any existing five or ten year Tax Cap elections, the amount charged for each year is the
value of the Tax Cap applicable in the first tax year covered by the election.
