Isle of Man Budget 2025-26
Revenue – Expenditure
Treasury will continue to follow the UK policy on state pensions. The UK Government has
recently confirmed that the pensions triple lock arrangement in relation to state pensions will
remain in place until the end of the current UK Parliament.
A report was presented to Tynwald in November 2024 outlining the options considered to
address the long term sustainability of the Manx National Insurance Fund. In recent months
further work has been undertaken and shared with Tynwald Members to develop a plan to
address this.
The NHS Allocation for 2025-26 and subsequent financial years has been revised upwards
due to Treasury now holding better statistical information which enables more accurate
forecasts to be made. This revision in isolation results in the 2025-26 allocation being £6.3
million higher than the previous forecast of £54.7 million in the 2024-25 Pink Book.
The NHS Allocation has been further increased for the 2025-26 tax year and subsequent four
financial years to allow additional monies from the Manx National Insurance Fund to be
allocated to the NHS following the reduction in the income tax rate from 22% to 21%.
The National Insurance investment income is forecast to continue to grow year on year over
the period of the indicative financial plan even with increased NHS allocations in the first three
years of the indicative plan. This is as a result of the anticipated effect of the implementation
of the revised investment strategy and market conditions stabilising. The actual outturn will of
course be dependent on the future investment market conditions.
5.6 Non-Pay Costs
Non-pay cost amounts have been increased for the 2025-26 financial year by 1% to partially
allow for inflationary pressures, however further cost savings and efficiencies will be required
by Departments to offset the expected levels of inflation.
