Isle of Man Budget 2025-26
The Capital Programme
New approvals total £35.5 million and there are £12.6 million of brought forward approvals
relating to existing schemes in the 2025-26 financial year.
Although 2024-25 performance forecasts suggest that the delivery will be higher than the
estimated delivery budgeted, this continues to track below the full estimated cost of the capital
programme. It therefore continues to be considered the most fiscally responsible approach to
include the full estimated costs into the capital funding plans as this represents the higher cost
exposure to Government.

Some capital projects for Manx Utilities are funded as a loan through the CLF and this will
continue into the future.
The majority of the Capital Programme for 2025-26 will continue to be delivered by the
Department of Infrastructure, as they are responsible for the management and maintenance
of most of the Government’s infrastructure assets and its own share of the public housing
stock.
Table 19A presents a summary of the Capital Programme split by Department and the
amounts for Tynwald approval. The detailed Capital Programme showing the budgeted
expenditure for 2025-26, in accordance with Section 3 of the Budget Order Paper, is shown
in Appendix 4 on a scheme by scheme basis.
The schemes that remain to be financed from the CLF are presented within Table 19B and
