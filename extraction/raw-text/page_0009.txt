Isle of Man Budget 2025-26
Five Year Financial Plan
The number of jobseekers in the Isle of Man (and by extension assumed unemployment)
remain historically low, at just over 300 individuals in November 2024. A number of recent
closures and redundancy announcements have not translated into any meaningful movement
in registered unemployed, suggesting employees have either easily found replacement work,
left the labour market (e.g. taken retirement), or left the Island altogether. The split of these
factors likely varies between economic sectors. Advertised vacancies have remained high,
with the official figure of approximately 700-900 roles expected to translate into around 1,300
total roles. Businesses continue to highlight challenges in sourcing workers which may
ultimately hold back further economic growth.
Jobs and Persons Employed as measured by the tax system have continued to grow, albeit
at a somewhat slower rate than has been seen in previous years.
Ongoing price pressures and reduced consumer disposable income in the domestic economy
continue to dampen economic sentiment. The hospitality sector has forecast difficult forward
trading conditions. A number of initiatives are underway to grow new economic sectors and
modernise the Island’s economy, including around Artificial Intelligence, Sustainable Finance,
Medicinal Cannabis, and Engineering. A new Local Economy Strategy 2024-34 will emphasise
investing in supporting locally driven projects to strengthen the existing retail, hospitality and
leisure sectors, which play a pivotal role in the Isle of Man’s proposition as being a great place
to live and work.
In conclusion, while the current economic climate is reasonably stable, there remain some key
risks across a number of sectors.
