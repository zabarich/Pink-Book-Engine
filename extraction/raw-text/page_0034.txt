Isle of Man Budget 2025-26
Revenue – Expenditure
5.7 Contingency Funding
The Treasury continue to hold a revenue contingency budget which can be accessed upon
presentation of a robust business case should Departments or Boards encounter
unanticipated costs that cannot be absorbed within the planned budget. The level of
contingency has been set at £19.7 million for 2025-26 to include capacity for departmental
pressures and can be allocated to departmental budgets, subject to applications to access
contingency funding being scrutinised in close detail. £10 million of this contingency funding
has been included specifically for potential Manx Care cost pressures.
In addition to the contingency funding held within the revenue budget there was £14.5 million
held within the Contingency Fund at the beginning of the 2024-25 financial year. This fund is
maintained to cover revenue requirements in excess of the amounts held within the general
revenue account.
The current forecasts show that approximately £4 million of the Contingency Fund will be
utilised during 2024-25 following an additional £1.5 million being added to this fund during the
year.
The balance to be carried forward at 1 April 2025 is estimated to be £12 million. This budget
includes an additional £5.5 million of funding for the Contingency Fund during 2025-26.
The Capital Programme also has a contingency amount included to provide funding to capital
projects that face emergency or unforeseen costs and pressures as well to provide assistance
with minor timing variances. It is proposed to include a Capital Contingency Budget of £9.9
million for 2025-26. A Capital Projects Inflation Budget of £2 million is also included within the
Capital Programme. Any claims by departments to access either the Capital Projects
Contingency Budget or the Capital Inflation Budget must be supported by a robust and current
business case that will be subject to detailed scrutiny by Treasury.
