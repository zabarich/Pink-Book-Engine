The amount paid to the Financial Services Authority is budgeted to reduce in the medium term
financial plan, recognising the fact that the Authority is continuing to move towards a model of
industry funding.
Grants and subventions have been increased taking into account affordability within the
Medium Term Financial Plan, inflationary pressures and the need to maintain service levels
at the relevant bodies.
The Manx Radio subvention includes an amount in relation to minor capital works.
There are no other changes planned to the levels of grants provided by Treasury to the other
bodies.
