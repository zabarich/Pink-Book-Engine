Isle of Man Budget 2025-26
Five Year Financial Plan
3. THE FIVE YEAR FINANCIAL PLAN
3.1 Summary
The budget for 2025-26 is presented along with the indicative financial plan for the subsequent
years through to 2029-30.
The plan has been based on a relatively stable economic environment with assumptions on
inflation remaining in line with trends in the medium term.
Our Island Plan and the Economic Strategy continue to drive the Government spending plans.
Our Island Plan has the following five overall themes:
• Building great communities
• An Island of health and wellbeing
• A strong and diverse economy
• An environment we can be proud of
• Outstanding lifelong learning and development opportunities for all
The Economic Strategy complements these themes with the following aims:
• Shape of the economy: 5,000 new jobs across new, enabling and existing key
sectors by 2032, reaching an overall GDP of £10bn
• Public finances: To generate over £200m of additional annual income to reinvest
in services and quality of life by 2032
• Sustainability: Substantially decarbonise the services part of the Island’s
economy by 2030, supporting an overall reduction of 35% in the Island’s
greenhouse gas emissions
• Infrastructure and services: Further develop the infrastructure and services of
our community to plan for an estimated population of 100,000 by 2037
Implementing the financial plan aims to reduce the reliance on the use of reserves to fund
ongoing Government spending.
Treasury remains focused on growing Government income and controlling expenditure to
create a sustainable financial base including the reduction in the use of external reserves to
allow these balances to grow.
Treasury recognises that this financial plan will be challenging, but it is essential for the
Government to adhere to financial discipline in order to protect the island reserves and to
deliver public services in a financially sustainable way. Strong budgetary control and focus on
cost control will need to be exercised as much as possible in all areas.
The Government wide efficiency programme aims to support the efficient delivery of public
services and will work alongside department initiatives to contain cost pressures within their
allocated budgets.
