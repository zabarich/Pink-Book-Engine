## 2. INDIVIDUAL CONTROL TESTS ✅ ALL WORKING

| Pillar 2 Tax | Disable | £0 | £0 | ✅ |
| Pensioner NI | Enable | £5,000,000 | £5,000,000 | ✅ |

### Expenditure Controls
| Control | Test Case | Result | Expected | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|----------|--------|
| Public Sector Pay | 3% → 4% | +£5,867,000 | +£5,867,000 | ✅ |

## 3. CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND ⚠️

### Issue 1: EFFICIENCY DOUBLE-COUNTING ✅ FIXED
**Location:** Lines 915-918 and 952 of `workshop/page.tsx`

**Problem:** Two separate efficiency savings were being applied simultaneously

**Solution Implemented:**
```typescript
// Line 915-918 - Advanced efficiency only applies if Basic is zero
if (efficiencyTarget === 0) {
  // Only apply Advanced efficiency measures if Basic efficiency target is not set
  newExpenditure -= efficiencyImpact
}

// Line 952 - Basic Controls efficiency always applies
newExpenditure -= efficiencyTarget * 1000000
```

**Fix Verified:**
- Basic Efficiency alone: ✅ Applies correctly
- Advanced Efficiency alone: ✅ Applies correctly  
- Both set: ✅ Only Basic applies (no double-counting)
- Warning message updated to clarify behavior

**Result:** Efficiency savings now correctly apply with priority:
1. If Basic Efficiency Target set → Use Basic only
2. If Basic is zero → Use Advanced measures
3. Never double-count

---

## 4. VERIFIED CORRECT IMPLEMENTATIONS ✅

### Capital vs Revenue Separation ✅
- Capital adjustments correctly NOT affecting revenue expenditure
- Lines 920-921 properly comment this separation
- `capitalAdjustmentsImpact` calculated but not applied to revenue/expenditure

### DOI Delivery Rate ✅
- Correctly applies only to £30m DOI Small Works budget
- Not incorrectly applied to entire £87.4m capital programme
- Line 621: `const doiSmallWorksBudget = 30000000`

### Tax Calculations ✅
- All tax calculations using correct Pink Book data
- No arbitrary multipliers found
- Proper employer/employee NI splits
- VAT FERSA adjustment properly applied

### Removed Duplicates ✅
- Old department-by-department adjustments commented out (lines 925-932)
- Old public sector pay calculation commented out (lines 934-939)
- Pension age savings not double-counted (line 963)

## 5. CALCULATION FLOW TEST

**Test Scenario:**
- Start: Baseline (Revenue £1,446,963,000, Expenditure £1,445,229,000)
- Add: Income tax +1% → Revenue +£16,514,500
- Add: Pay +1% → Expenditure +£5,867,000
- Subtract: Efficiency £10m → Expenditure -£10,000,000

**Results:**
- Final Revenue: £1,463,477,500 ✅
- Final Expenditure: £1,441,096,000 ✅
- Final Balance: £22,381,500 ✅
- Change from Base: £20,647,500 ✅

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS

### MUST FIX:
1. **Resolve efficiency double-counting** - Choose one approach:
   - Option A: Only apply Basic OR Advanced efficiency (not both)
   - Option B: Rename to clarify difference (e.g., "Strategic Efficiency" vs "Operational Savings")
   - Option C: Combine into single unified efficiency control

### ALREADY FIXED:
- ✅ Winter Bonus path corrected (`winter_bonus` not `winterBonus`)
- ✅ Baseline calculations verified correct
- ✅ Tax calculations accurate
- ✅ Capital/revenue properly separated

### WORKING CORRECTLY:
- ✅ All baseline values match Pink Book
- ✅ Individual controls calculate properly
- ✅ No hardcoded values in calculations
- ✅ Proper JSON data sourcing
