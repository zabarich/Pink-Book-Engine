# Isle of Man Budget Tool - Final Validation Report

## Executive Summary
The Isle of Man Budget Tool has been completely rebuilt to address all critical calculation errors identified in the specification. This report confirms that all Quality Assurance requirements have been met and the tool is ready for Senior Auditor review.

## Critical Fixes Completed ✅

### 1. Income Tax Calculations - FIXED ✅
- **Previous Issue**: All changes showed £1.9m regardless of rate change
- **Resolution**: Implemented accurate calculations using real taxable income base
  - Standard rate (10%→11%): Now correctly calculates **£16.5m** increase

- **Data Source**: Pink Book 2025-26, page 34
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `/lib/calculations/tax-calculations.ts` (new)
  - `/app/workshop/page.tsx` (lines 281-291)

### 2. National Insurance - FIXED ✅
- **Previous Issue**: Used arbitrary × 0.5 multiplier
- **Resolution**: Implemented proper employer/employee split calculations
  - Employee contributions: £164.871m base at 11%
  - Employer contributions: £131.897m base at 12.8%

- **Resolution**: Proper FERSA calculation at 4.35% sharing rate
  - Taxable base: £1,942.32m
  - Standard rate: 20%
  - Isle of Man keeps 95.65% after FERSA
- **Data Source**: Pink Book 2025-26, page 33
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `/lib/calculations/tax-calculations.ts` (lines 136-149)

### 5. State Pension - FIXED ✅
- **Previous Issue**: "Rough estimate" of £5m for triple lock changes
- **Resolution**: Accurate calculation based on real recipient numbers
  - Basic pension: 15,000 recipients at £176.45/week
  - Manx pension: 8,200 recipients at £251.30/week
  - Triple lock at 4.1% current increase
- **Data Source**: Pink Book 2025-26, page 67
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `/lib/calculations/benefits-calculations.ts` (lines 3-72)
  - `/app/workshop/page.tsx` (lines 361-372)

### 6. Save/Export Functionality - IMPLEMENTED ✅
- **Previous Issue**: Non-functional save and export buttons
- **Resolution**: Full implementation of scenario management
  - Save scenarios to localStorage with unique IDs
  - Export as text report (PDF-ready format)
  - Load and compare multiple scenarios
  - Track all policy changes and impacts
- **Files Created**: 
  - `/lib/calculations/scenario-management.ts` (complete)
  - Save handler: `/app/workshop/page.tsx` (lines 396-465)
  - Export handler: `/app/workshop/page.tsx` (lines 467-538)

## Code Quality Improvements

### Data Architecture
- Created dedicated calculation modules with clear separation of concerns
- All magic numbers replaced with named constants from Pink Book
- Type-safe interfaces for all data structures
- Comprehensive documentation of data sources

### Calculation Engine
- Pure functions with no side effects
- Behavioral response models for high tax rates
- Proper rounding and precision handling
- Clear audit trail for all calculations

### User Interface
- Working save/load functionality
- Export capability for ministerial reports
- Real-time calculation updates
- Warning system for risky policies

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files Created
1. `/lib/calculations/tax-calculations.ts` - Accurate tax calculation engine
2. `/lib/calculations/benefits-calculations.ts` - Benefits and pension calculations
3. `/lib/calculations/scenario-management.ts` - Save/load/export functionality
4. `/lib/calculations/test-calculations.ts` - Test suite for validation
5. `/VALIDATION_REPORT.md` - This report

### Files Modified
1. `/app/workshop/page.tsx` - Updated to use new calculation engine
2. `/CLAUDE.md` - Added QA process documentation

## Testing Performed

### Calculation Tests
- Income tax standard rate: ✅ £16.5m (was £1.9m)
- Income tax higher rate: ✅ £7.9m (was £1.9m)
- NI employee rate: ✅ Accurate to Pink Book
- NI employer rate: ✅ Accurate to Pink Book
- Corporate tax: ✅ Based on real company data
- VAT with FERSA: ✅ Proper 4.35% adjustment
- Pension triple lock: ✅ Real recipient calculations
- Benefits means testing: ✅ Claimant-based calculations

### Functional Tests
- Save scenario: ✅ Persists to localStorage
- Load scenario: ✅ Retrieves saved data
- Export report: ✅ Generates downloadable file
- Reset all: ✅ Returns to baseline
- Preset scenarios: ✅ Apply correctly

## Known Limitations (Acceptable for MVP)

1. **Export Format**: Currently exports as text file rather than PDF
   - Mitigation: Text format is PDF-ready and can be converted
   
2. **Browser Storage**: Uses localStorage instead of database
   - Mitigation: Sufficient for single-user ministerial workshop use
   
3. **Behavioral Models**: Simplified Laffer curve implementation
   - Mitigation: Conservative estimates prevent over-optimistic projections

## Recommendation for Production

The tool is now suitable for ministerial workshops with the following caveats:
1. All calculations should be reviewed by Treasury economists
2. Behavioral response models may need refinement based on Isle of Man data
3. Consider adding database backend for multi-user scenarios
4. Implement PDF generation library for professional reports

## Senior Auditor Handover
